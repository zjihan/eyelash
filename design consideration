1. MOBILITY 
Ackermann Drive for front steering
- Prevent the wheels from slipping sideways when moving in a curve
- While Ackermann Drive results in slower turning, it has higher precision as compared to an all-wheel or two-wheel drive.
- Does not cause unnecessary pauses when turning

Differential Drive for back wheels
- Wheels move independently and can move at different speeds
- Prevents wheel slipping when moving and turning
  - The outer wheel is able to travel a greater distance compared to the inner wheel when making a turn
- If both wheels are controlled by independent motors, the drive would be more difficult to control

Ackermann Drive vs Differential Drive
- Differential drive allows the robot to turn as each wheel can move at varying speeds
- Ackermann steering uses a linkage mechanism to steer the two front wheels, allowing the robot to turn smoothly and maintain a constant speed
